# Whisper Octopus: 100-Day MVP Challenge

## Executive Summary

Whisper Octopus is a multi-tenant, AI-enhanced customer support platform to be developed over a 100-day coding challenge. This refactored plan adopts a pragmatic MVP approach, focusing on core functionality while reducing technical complexity. The platform will serve multiple businesses (B2B) and their customers (B2C), with a streamlined technology stack centered around Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and targeted AI enhancements. Each business tenant will have their own isolated environment within the shared platform, allowing for separate teams, knowledge bases, and customer portals. This approach balances ambition with achievability, ensuring a functional end-to-end system within the 100-day timeframe.

## Business Objectives

1. **Deliver Core Platform Functionality**
    - Create essential B2B agent tools for ticket management across multiple tenants
    - Build fundamental B2C customer self-service capabilities with tenant-specific branding
    - Establish a shared knowledge base system with proper tenant isolation

2. **Implement Multi-Tenant Architecture**
    - Design a secure tenant isolation model from the ground up
    - Create tenant onboarding and management capabilities
    - Support tenant-specific configurations and branding

3. **Demonstrate Practical AI Integration**
    - Implement smart ticket classification and routing within tenant boundaries
    - Create a simplified RAG system for tenant-specific knowledge retrieval
    - Develop basic agent assistance capabilities

4. **Create a Sustainable Foundation**
    - Build on a simplified but scalable multi-tenant architecture
    - Focus on quality and testing for core features
    - Establish patterns for future expansion

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Multi-tenant complexity | High | Implement tenant isolation early; use consistent patterns throughout |
| Tenant data leakage | Critical | Comprehensive testing of tenant boundaries; security audit |
| AI integration complexity | High | Focus on specific, well-defined AI features with fallbacks |
| Learning curve for vector search | Medium | Start with simple similarity search, increase sophistication over time |
| Performance with multiple tenants | Medium | Implement caching early, monitor performance by tenant |
| Scope creep | High | Maintain strict prioritization, defer non-MVP features |
| Technical debt | Medium | Regular refactoring sessions, maintain test coverage |

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Test coverage >75% for core components
- API response time <500ms for 95% of requests across tenants
- Successful tenant isolation in security tests
- Successful AI classifications >80% accuracy
- System uptime >99.5% during testing

### Business Metrics
- Support agent productivity improvement
- Customer self-service resolution rate by tenant
- Knowledge article utilization
- Ticket resolution time reduction
- Tenant onboarding completion rate

## Conclusion

This refactored plan focuses on delivering a complete, functional MVP of the Whisper Octopus platform within the 100-day timeline, with multi-tenancy as a core architectural feature. By implementing tenant isolation from the beginning, the platform becomes more commercially viable while still maintaining a streamlined technology stack and focused feature set.

The multi-tenant MVP approach creates a solid foundation that can be expanded upon after the challenge. Future enhancements could include the originally planned advanced AI capabilities, additional data stores for specialized use cases, more sophisticated tenant customization options, and advanced deployment infrastructure.
